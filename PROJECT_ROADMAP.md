## üö® Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items

1. **Database Schema Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Complex relationships may cause performance issues
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple schema, iterate based on testing

2. **File Storage Performance**
   - **Risk**: Large document uploads may cause timeouts
   - **Mitigation**: Implement chunked uploads and progress tracking

3. **Real-time Features**
   - **Risk**: Supabase Realtime warnings may indicate stability issues
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor closely, have fallback to polling if needed

### Medium Risk Items

1. **User Experience Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Complex workflows may confuse users
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive user testing and iterative design

2. **Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Multiple system integrations may cause issues
   - **Mitigation**: Start with core features, add integrations incrementally

### Low Risk Items

1. **UI/UX Design**
   - **Risk**: Design may not meet user expectations
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven design patterns and user feedback

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Risk**: Performance targets may not be met
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous monitoring and optimization
