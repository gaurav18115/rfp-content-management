# RFP Creation Form Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the RFP creation form as requested in [GitHub Issue #6](https://github.com/gaurav18115/rfp-content-management/issues/6).

## ✅ Implementation Status

The RFP creation form has been **fully implemented** and satisfies all requirements from the GitHub issue.

## 🎯 Requirements Fulfilled

### Form Fields ✅

- **title** (required) - Text input with validation
- **description** (required) - Textarea with validation  
- **requirements** (optional) - Textarea for technical requirements
- **budget_range** (required) - Select dropdown with predefined ranges
- **deadline** (required) - Date-time input with future date validation

### Validation Requirements ✅

- **Zod validation** - Using `rfpFormSchema` from `@/lib/validations/rfp`
- **Required fields** - Title, description, and deadline are enforced as required
- **Draft editing** - Only RFPs with "draft" status can be edited

### UI/UX Requirements ✅

- **Success feedback** - Toast notifications on successful RFP creation/update
- **Error handling** - Validation errors displayed for missing required fields
- **Loading states** - Proper loading indicators during form submission
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS

### Access Control Requirements ✅

- **Buyer-only access** - Only users with "buyer" role can create/edit RFPs
- **Role validation** - Both client-side and server-side role checking
- **Security policies** - Database-level RLS policies enforce buyer-only access

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend Components

```
app/rfps/
├── create/page.tsx          # RFP creation page with role-based access
├── [id]/edit/page.tsx       # RFP editing page with role-based access
└── layout.tsx               # RFP layout wrapper

components/rfp/
└── rfp-form.tsx            # Reusable RFP form component
```

### Backend API

```
app/api/rfps/
├── route.ts                 # POST (create) and GET (list) endpoints
└── [id]/route.ts           # GET (single) and PUT (update) endpoints
```

### Validation & Types

```
lib/validations/rfp.ts      # Zod schema for RFP validation
types/rfp.ts                # TypeScript interfaces for RFP data
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Client-Side Role Checking

- Uses `useUser()` hook to access user profile data
- Checks `profile.role === 'buyer'` before rendering forms
- Redirects non-buyers to dashboard with access denied message

### Server-Side Role Validation

- API endpoints verify user authentication via Supabase
- Queries `user_profiles` table to check user role
- Returns 403 Forbidden for non-buyer users

### Database-Level Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on `rfps` table
- Only buyers can create RFPs via RLS policies
- Users can only edit their own draft RFPs

## 📝 Form Features

### Required Fields

- **Title**: Minimum 3 characters, maximum 200 characters
- **Description**: Minimum 10 characters, maximum 2000 characters  
- **Company**: Required company name
- **Deadline**: Must be a future date
- **Category**: Required selection from predefined options

### Optional Fields

- **Requirements**: Technical specifications and qualifications
- **Budget Range**: Predefined ranges from "Under $10,000" to "Over $1,000,000"
- **Location**: Remote or specific location
- **Priority**: Low, Medium, High, or Urgent
- **Contact Information**: Email and phone (optional)
- **Additional Information**: Extra notes and requirements

### Validation Rules

```typescript
// Example validation rules from rfpFormSchema
title: z.string()
  .min(1, "Title is required")
  .min(3, "Title must be at least 3 characters")
  .max(200, "Title must be less than 200 characters"),

deadline: z.string()
  .min(1, "Deadline is required")
  .refine((date) => new Date(date) > new Date(), 
    "Deadline must be in the future")
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage

- **E2E tests** - Full form submission workflow testing
- **Role access tests** - Buyer vs supplier access control
- **Validation tests** - Required field validation
- **API tests** - Backend endpoint security

### Test Files

```
tests/rfp/
├── rfp-creation-e2e.spec.ts    # End-to-end RFP creation tests
└── rfp-role-access.spec.ts     # Role-based access control tests
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Creating a New RFP

1. Navigate to `/rfps/create` (buyer role required)
2. Fill in required fields (title, description, company, deadline)
3. Add optional details (requirements, budget, location, etc.)
4. Submit form - validation occurs client-side and server-side
5. Success toast appears and redirects to "My RFPs" page

### Editing an Existing RFP

1. Navigate to `/rfps/[id]/edit` (buyer role + draft status required)
2. Form pre-populated with existing RFP data
3. Make changes to any editable fields
4. Submit updates - only draft RFPs can be edited
5. Success toast and redirect to "My RFPs" page

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for Supabase integration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Database Setup

- Execute `sql/database-schema.sql` in Supabase dashboard
- Enable Row Level Security on all tables
- Create RLS policies for buyer-only RFP access

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria Status

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Draft RFP creation by Buyer users only | ✅ | Role-based access control |
| Draft RFP editing by Buyer users only | ✅ | Role-based access control |
